# Automated Minutes of Meeting



## Problem Statement
Organizations often conduct meetings to discuss various matters, make decisions, and collaborate on projects. \
The manual process of creating MOMs is often time-consuming, prone to errors, and can lead to delays in distributing essential information to stakeholders. \
Participants often forget some important information and it becomes difficult to have accurate information presented. \
People also face connectivity issues which can lead to loss of information. 


## Solution
Building a background application which will automate the process of generation and mailing the MOM summary.

Work on two types of models and compare the outcomes:\
Natural Language Processing\
Large Language Models 

Store the important summary of MOM on firestore.
Automate the mailing process with the use of GCP functions.
